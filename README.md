# Android Challenge For Teamwork
Teamwork Challenge

A few missing stuff because of time constraints:
  - A sample unit test is present just to show the thought process(also mockweb
  - Missing back button on detail fragment
  - There isn't much java on this challenge but I am happy to discuss (it was mostly callbacks present with this arch)
